create a folder in computer 
note: the folder name should contain all the small letters

now go to the nextjs website and copy the command
npx create-next-app@latest

now i have created the folder so if i will run the above the command in the terminal then it will 
create the project inside the folder it means folder inside the folder

so we will copy the command and add . (DOT) 
like this : npx create-next-app@latest .
this will create the project inside it.

now i have to push the files in git
the git were already initialised by the npm 
so now we have to change the master branch to main changing the existing branch to main

1.	git branch -M main

now we have to set the origin

2. git remote add origin https://github.com/HuzaifaJabbar17/nextjsauth.git

now we have to set the upstream 

3. git push -u origin main

now all files are uploaded on git
