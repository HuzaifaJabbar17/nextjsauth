create a folder in computer 
note: the folder name should contain all the small letters

now go to the nextjs website and copy the command
npx create-next-app@latest

now i have created the folder so if i will run the above the command in the terminal then it will 
create the project inside the folder it means folder inside the folder

so we will copy the command and add . (DOT) 
like this : npx create-next-app@latest .
this will create the project inside it.

now i have to push the files in git
the git were already initialised by the npm 
so now we have to change the master branch to main changing the existing branch to main

1.	git branch -M main

now we have to set the origin

2. git remote add origin https://github.com/HuzaifaJabbar17/nextjsauth.git

now we have to set the upstream 

3. git push -u origin main

now all files are uploaded on git 

now understand the folder structure of nextjs
we have three root folders node_modules, public, src

in src we have app folder
to handle an api we have to create an api folder in app 

app ----> api

api folder will contain our backend in simple terms
in api folder we will have routes 

app ----> api --->login ---->route.ts
here app,api & login all are folder

to handle page it would be inside app folder

app 
---->api
---->contact--->page.ts
---->login--->page.ts

here app,api,contact,login all are folders and page.ts is a file

api folder will have backend 
and contact & login page are frontend
all the folders in app except api will have one file only that is page.tsx


api folder is a collection folder 
now we have many functionalities in our website we create folder for every different entity for example user will login, signUp

the file inside login will be route.ts

always start your project from backend it give you the basic idea
1.data modelling



now create an .env file in root folder
and it will have all the secret information of our project

now data modelling will be done inside our src folder 
we will create a new folder models

src
---->app
---->models

we have to create models
now we need mongoose to talk to mongodb 
npm i mongoose

isverify and forgotpasswordtoken concept is on 20:00 of the video 2

always remember that NEXTJS IS AN EDGE FRAMEWORK
that nextjs dont know that its connection has been made or not with databases
connecting first time or its already connected so we have to remember both the cases in nextjs

if model is already created in the database then give us referece of that model otherwise create that model in mongodb
