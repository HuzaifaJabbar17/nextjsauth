create a folder in computer 
note: the folder name should contain all the small letters

now go to the nextjs website and copy the command
npx create-next-app@latest

now i have created the folder so if i will run the above the command in the terminal then it will 
create the project inside the folder it means folder inside the folder

so we will copy the command and add . (DOT) 
like this : npx create-next-app@latest .
this will create the project inside it.

now i have to push the files in git
the git were already initialised by the npm 
so now we have to change the master branch to main changing the existing branch to main

1.	git branch -M main

now we have to set the origin

2. git remote add origin https://github.com/HuzaifaJabbar17/nextjsauth.git

now we have to set the upstream 

3. git push -u origin main

now all files are uploaded on git 

now understand the folder structure of nextjs
we have three root folders node_modules, public, src

in src we have app folder
to handle an api we have to create an api folder in app 

app ----> api

api folder will contain our backend in simple terms
in api folder we will have routes 

app ----> api --->login ---->route.ts
here app,api & login all are folder

to handle page it would be inside app folder

app 
---->api
---->contact--->page.ts
---->login--->page.ts

here app,api,contact,login all are folders and page.ts is a file

api folder will have backend 
and contact & login page are frontend
all the folders in app except api will have one file only that is page.tsx


api folder is a collection folder 
now we have many functionalities in our website we create folder for every different entity for example user will login, signUp

the file inside login will be route.ts

always start your project from backend it give you the basic idea
1.data modelling



now create an .env file in root folder
and it will have all the secret information of our project

now data modelling will be done inside our src folder 
we will create a new folder models

src
---->app
---->models

we have to create models
now we need mongoose to talk to mongodb 
npm i mongoose

isverify and forgotpasswordtoken concept is on 20:00 of the video 2

always remember that NEXTJS IS AN EDGE FRAMEWORK
that nextjs dont know that its connection has been made or not with databases
connecting first time or its already connected so we have to remember both the cases in nextjs

if model is already created in the database then give us referece of that model otherwise create that model in mongodb

creating dbconfig folder in src
in dbConfig folder we will have our database connection

here in dbconfig file we have assured that the process.env.MONGO_URI is a string by giving exclimintion mark  process.env.MONGO_URI!

we always have to exit the process in catch block while connecting to mongodb

create a helpers folder in src directory

in nodemailer files or mailer.ts 
we have to run this command after installing nodemailer
npm i --save-dev @types/nodemailer 
because we are using typescript we have to types in dev dependencies by runnig the above command

after any object or variable we are defining its datatype ----> : any

NEXTJS biggest problem is folder based routing

IMPORTANT NOTE : NEXTJS IS AN EDGE TIME FRAMEWORK IN EVERY ROUTE WE HAVE TO CHECK WHETHER THE CONNECTION IS ALIVE WITH DATABASE OR NOT
so every route needs dbconfig file  in every api file
import { connect } from "@/dbConfig/dbConfig";
and then the first thing we have to call connect();

to import any file use "@/"


to use any route methods we have to do like this 
example ------->
export async function POST(request : nextRequest){

}

export async function RESTAPIMETHOD(request:nextRequest){

}
in this project we not validating the incoming request 
to hash the password we used bcryptjs 
and after importing we have to give type of bcrypt file
npm i --save-dev @types/bcryptjs

nextResponse.json(object,object)
nextResponse will take object as an arguement

bcrypt include special characters whereas uuid libraray doesnt include special characters 

go to mailtrap to send email
replace the createTransport function from mailtrap in our code 
go to email testing --> go to your inbox ---> go to integration -----> choose nodemailer
copy the code and paste it on your code 

we need to give user and password in .env file

for html create a new document and give a reference there

NOTE :reqBody is a promise so we have to wait there so write await before getting reqbody 

always use await in database calls

here we are defining what a user can do 
signin,login,logout,verifyemail, go to profile

all the folder would be in users folder 
and the folder will contain route.ts file

to create a token we need data to create token based on it

process.env.TOKEN_SECRET! may be it is present or not thats why we put exclimination mark at the the end

MONGO_URi=mongodb+srv://jabbarhuzaifa123:NVfNK4R7ovTcMcEY@nextauthcluster.pzqv2kk.mongodb.net/auth?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=nextauthcluster

added database name in  between of /?
 

 we are expecting in verify email route that we will send token in body in json format
 findbyIdAndUpdate take two aguement 1. on which basis you want to find 2.On what do you want to update it must be an Object
